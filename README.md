# Rhino3d-Tools
A hopeful repository of hopefully useful Python scripts and js to run in and work with Rhino3d

The intent of the files here is to build a Rhino export tool that will build an html file, pull in three.js and display models in the browser, with possible hosting in the cloud.

Avert your eyes! I haven't had time to freshen up. This is a work in progress. It likely won't work, but the python file will if you just want to batch export meshes for now. 



This project has nothing to do with Coffee Script, it uses dastardly jquery and doesn't even need to. I will be changing these things.

It should be noted that I am using a highly expirmental setup with Atom, the RhinoPython package for Atom, and Beta Rhino 3d for mac.
